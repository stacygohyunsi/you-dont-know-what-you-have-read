# David and Golaith

This book starts off by telling the story of David and Golaith - where Golaith is a very huge and buff warrior and david is a small-framed shepherd. 

In this epic battle where the odds are obviously against David, David surprisingly (or expectedly?) wins the battle by hurling a stone from his sling which hits Goliath in the center of his forehead. Goliath then falls on his face to the ground, and David cuts off his head.


**Learnings/takeaways/quotes**

1. Things arent always as it seems. One of the phrases in the book mentioned - "Would you wish dyslexia on your child?" Although Dyslexia might seem like a disability, sometimes learning how to deal with the possibility of failure can produce unexpected results.

2. Be more disagreeable - it means to be willing to take social risks - to do what others might disapprove of. "The reasonable man adapts himself to the world. The unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man."

3. There are limits to what evil and misfortune can accomplish. If you take away the gift of reading, you create the gift of listening. 

4. Those in power need to understand the “principle of legitimacy" -  First of all, the people who are asked to obey authority have to feel like they have a voice—that if they speak up, they will be heard. Second, the law has to be predictable. There has to be a reasonable expectation that the rules tomorrow are going to be roughly the same as the rules today. And third, the authority has to be fair. It can’t treat one group differently from another.
