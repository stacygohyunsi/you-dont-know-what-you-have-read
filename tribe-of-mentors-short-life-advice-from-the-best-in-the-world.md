# Tribe of Mentors: Short Life Advice from the Best in the World

This book is literally what the title promises. Overall, it was a book I really enjoyed reading because there's some really good advice in there and the best part is they are all bite-sized, which makes it easier to remember and internalise. 

I struggled to complete the entire book though - was a wee bit too long.

**Learnings/takeaways/quotes**
There is alot of advice in the book, but I've picked out a few quotes/advice which I really like and will try to apply them in my daily life. You can call them my 'note to self's.

1. Never worry about competition- be inspired and be you.
2. When scoring, don't choose 7 (it's too neutral, force yourself to choose a number lower than that or more than that, and make a decision then)
3. Go deep
4. "Not dead, can't quit"
5. life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage
6. Everything takes time 
7. (being a “chef” who comes up with a recipe) versus reasoning by analogy (being a “cook” who follows someone else’s recipe).
8. We all have two main characters in our heads: a rational decision-maker (the adult in your head) and an instant gratification monkey (the child in your head who doesn’t care about consequences and just wants to maximize the ease and pleasure of the current moment). compartmentalise ur time, so the monkey has something to look forward to
9. Society loves to glorify the “you-as-CEO” paths and make people who don’t want to be the CEO of their own career feel inferior about their path, but neither of these paths is inherently better or worse than the other—it just depends on your personality, your goals, and what you want from a lifestyle.
10. The epitaph test
11. Don’t let someone knock you off course before you reach your destination. Trust the work. Always trust the work.
12. “You can be a juicy ripe peach and there’ll still be someone who doesn’t like peaches.”
13. “When my legs hurt, I say, ‘Shut up, legs! Do what I tell you to do!’”
14. Did I do my best, given who I was and what I knew at that particular time?
15. True fulfillment comes from love of the process.
16. Live fully in moments with the people I love
17. Define faith as the ability to hear the music beneath the noise.
18. “If you think you are too small to be effective, you have never been in the dark with a mosquito.”
19. You’ll always have less attention than time.
20. Learning to enjoy the process, rather than always striving for the future.
21. The low of failure would never match the low of shame.
22. Figure out what success means to you.
23. Learning to say no to meetings is a necessary skill
