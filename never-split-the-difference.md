# Never split the difference: Negotiating as if your life depended on it

**Learnings/takeaways/quotes**

1. Negotiators are often afraid when people say "no" to them - they feel like success only comes with a 'yes'. In the book, the author says "No" is not a form of rejection. People say "no" because they feel uncomfortable and it protects themselves. After people say no, you realise that they will be more open to hearing what the other party has to say and that is when they can consider other possibilities. 


2. Labelling - What labeling means is to validate someone's emotions by saying something like “it seems like...”, “it looks like..”, “it sounds like..”. E.g., "it seems like you are feeling anxious today." And when you label the counterparty's emotions, take a pause and let it sink in. By labelling, you show you identify with how the person feels. Labelling has a special advantage when your counterpart is tense. Exposing negative thoughts by repeating it to them makes the thoughts seem less frightening. 


3. Mirroring (isopraxism), means to simply repeat the gist of the sentence of what someone has just said.
