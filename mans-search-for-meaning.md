On the other hand, the person who attacks the problem of life actively is like a man who removes each successive lead from his calendar and files it neatly and carefully with its predecessors, after first having jotted down a few diary notes on the back"

4. Paradoxical intention -  brings out the fear which one is afraid of. For example, a young physician used to have the fear of perspiring excessively, he said to himself "I only sweated a quart before, but now I am going to sweat at least 10 quarts!" and the result is him freeing himself from his phobia. "The neurotic who learns to laugh at himself may be on the way to self management, perhaps to cure."
