# How to win friends and influence people

**Learnings/takeaways/quotes**

In this book, the author emphasizes a lot on how to treat other people and the techniques to talk to others. However, what I dont like about this book is that it basically tells me to be agreeable to others all the time. It feels like it is telling you to lean towards being a people pleaser more often than not, which is something I don't want to do all the time. Nevertheless, there are a few points which I thought were worth noting: 

1. The author says to not use 'but' when praising someone and then telling someone the things to improve on. He says that someone might might feel encourage, until he hears the word 'but', and then might question the sincerity of the praise. A better way would to use 'and'. 

"Johnny we are really proud of you for coming first in your competition, but you should take note of your grades."

"Johnny we are really proud of you for coming first in your competition and it would be even more perfect if you can work harder for your grades."

2. To motivate someone, throw down a challenge. Everyone loves a chance to prove his self worth.

3. A point the author brought up was to dramatise your ideas. Something I am not sure about - Yes, one needs to be a good salesman and a good storyteller, but I am not sure if dramatising your ideas would affect your trustworthiness.

4. If you are wrong, admit it quickly.
