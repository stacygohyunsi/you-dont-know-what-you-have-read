# When breath turns to air

**Learnings/takeaways/quotes**

Overall, this was a really good book on an inspiring, talented man who's full of passion, grit yet so real at the same time.

1. Life sometimes is beyond our own control

2. Sometimes life is not all about being happy and satisfying your own desires. In the book, he describes about how he is a workaholic at heart when he could not stay away from his job even after recovering from his illness.

3. Also, he mentioned that there are two ways people react to a situation where they know they will not live for long. First, those who try to enjoy the worldly desires with whatever time they have remaining, and the second group of people still continue living like nothing has changed. Got me thinking which group I belong to

4. Cancer or any illness is real. Appreciate your life currently and embrace it. (:
